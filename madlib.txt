I walk through the color jungle. I take out my GATORADE canteen.
There's a GIANT parrot with a BLUE GLASSES on his BEAK in front of me in the COCONUT tree! I gaze at his BIG WEIRD GLASSES.
A sudden sound awakes me from my daydream!
A panther DANCES in front of my head! I FEEL his MINTY breath.
I remember I have a packet of ALTOIDS that makes him go into a deep slumber!
I SLINK away behind a ROCK.
Yes he's eating it! I MADE IT through the INSANE jungle. I meet my parents at the tent.
Phew; Itâ€™s been an exciting day in the jungle.
